			<h1>about the fanlisting</h1>
			<p><b>glitter &amp; sparkle dusts &amp; magicks</b> was created in november of 2016. mostly i was bored and missed coding. dare me has always been one of my favorite books so i wanted to make a little fanlisting of it, since none existed yet.</p>

			<h1>about the owner</h1>
			<p>hello! my name is <i>marley</i>. i'm 19 years old and an art student in seattle, wa. i'm hella queer and genderfluid (they/them please). i have always loved coding, my first sites were petz fansites. i made dozens of them and maybe one or two made it online (you can still see the last one <a href="http://fantazzled.com/epiphany/" target="_blank">here</a>). after that i got into fanlistings for a bit but quickly abandoned those (can you see a theme here? lol). this time i decided to keep it simple so even if i got bored i wouldn't feel obligated to update except the occasional addition of a member.<br>
